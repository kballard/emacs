defunkt's .emacs
================

This is Aquamacs specific, for now.  I'll factor out the specific

I also plan to break my custom config into multiple files, eventually.


Installation
============

$ cd ~/ProjectsOrWhatever
$ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/emacs.git
$ ruby ~/ProjectsOrWhatever/emacs/install.rb
